// Game: Snake the Virus
by Mihaila Alexandra & Dupu Robert

*SINGLE MODE*

There is a Virus, called Snake, living in a home computer. His job is to destroy byte by byte your computer. Along his way to conquear the PC, he "eats" 0, 1, <<, - and a plum. The first two are the equivalent of fruits in the classic snake game, and the last three are powerups.
"0" -> 10 points;
"1" -> 20 points;
"<<" -> doubles fruits' score for 20 seconds;
"-" -> cuts half of the Snake's tail;
plum -> is an antivirus which affects Snake's directions for 20 seconds - also Snake's colour changes;
